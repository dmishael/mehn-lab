## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner after the lab has been introduced.

Pair programming is a common industry practice where two developers work on the same project together. Typically, one person is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator". Throughout the lab you must switch roles.

[Here is an explanation of a structured pair-programming approach.](https://www.versionone.com/agile-101/agile-software-programming-best-practices/pair-programming/).

## Domains
